    <h1>Cole Patten Fall 2021</h1>
    <div id="accordion">
        <h3>CSC334 - Web Development</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Students will develop the skills necessary to prototype, design, test, and deploy web applications using modern frameworks and technologies. Development of applications that are RESTful is emphasized, but other communication structures may be explored. Security, scalability, user experience, and accessibility are additional considerations of delivering these pieces of software that will be analyzed.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>MATH321 - Differential Equations</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Selected topics from ordinary differential equations including development and applications of first order, higher order linear and systems of linear equations, general solutions and solutions to initial-value problems using matrices. Additional topics may include Laplace transforms and power series solutions.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>MATH401 - Senior Capstone</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Two semester course: In the first semester, students will carry out activities which are designed to refresh mathematics skills and develop skills such as research, writing, and presenting which will prepare them for the second semester in which they will write a major paper under faculty supervision and give a presentation based on that paper.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>MATH515 - Advanced Linear Algebra</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Advanced topics in linear algebra.  This course may cover topics useful in such applications as matrix factorizations, finite element methods, multivariable statistics, stochastic models, and parallel programming for scientific computations.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>STAT684 - Statistical Inference I</h3>
        <div>
            <p>A theoretical study of the foundations of statistics, including probability, random variables, expectations, moment generating functions, sample theory, and limiting distributions.</p>
        </div>
